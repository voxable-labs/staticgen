Bridgetown is a Webpack-aware, Ruby-powered static site generator for the modern Jamstack era. Bridgetown takes your content and frontend assets, renders Markdown and Liquid templates, and exports a complete website ready to be served by Jamstack services like Netlify or traditional web servers like Nginx.
